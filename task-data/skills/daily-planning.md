# Skill: Daily Planning

## Purpose

Create a realistic, energy-aware plan for the day.

## Process

1. Check current time and remaining hours in workday
2. Review all active tasks
3. Identify tasks with today's due date → must include
4. Match tasks to energy patterns:
   - Morning (high energy): Deep work, complex tasks
   - Afternoon (medium): Meetings, collaborative work
   - Evening (low): Admin, quick wins
5. Limit to 3-5 Most Important Tasks (MITs)
6. Include buffer time for unexpected items

## Output Format

"Here's your plan for today:

**Must Do**

- [ ] [Urgent/due today task]

**Focus Time** (when you have energy)

- [ ] [High-priority deep work]

**Quick Wins** (low energy moments)

- [ ] [Easy task 1]
- [ ] [Easy task 2]

Does this look right?"
