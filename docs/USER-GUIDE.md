## Understanding Your Tasks

### Categories

Every task gets automatically sorted into a category:

| Category     | What goes here                  | Examples                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Work**     | Professional tasks, job-related | Reports, meetings, emails       |
| **Personal** | Personal life, relationships    | Gifts, calls to friends/family  |
| **Home**     | House maintenance, chores       | Repairs, cleaning, organizing   |
| **Errands**  | Tasks outside the house         | Shopping, pickups, appointments |
| **Health**   | Exercise, medical, wellness     | Doctor visits, gym, medication  |
| **Finance**  | Money-related tasks             | Bills, budgeting, taxes         |
| **Learning** | Education, skill development    | Courses, reading, practice      |
| **Someday**  | No urgency, future ideas        | Wishes, "maybe" items           |

Don't worry about categorizing yourself - just describe the task and Vibe Planning figures it out!

### Priority Levels

Tasks are prioritized based on:

- **Due dates** - Something due tomorrow beats something due next month
- **Impact** - Big important tasks rise to the top
- **Your energy** - Morning tasks for focus work, evening for quick wins

| Priority   | What it means                        | Example                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **High**   | Do today or ASAP, deadline imminent  | "Report due Friday"            |
| **Medium** | Do this week, important but flexible | "Schedule dentist appointment" |
| **Low**    | Nice to do, no deadline              | "Research vacation ideas"      |

### Energy Levels

Tasks also have an energy level to help match work to how you're feeling:

| Energy     | Best for                    | Examples                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **High**   | Deep work, complex thinking | Writing, planning, creating |
| **Medium** | Active work, collaboration  | Meetings, calls, organizing |
| **Low**    | Simple tasks, routine       | Email, quick calls, admin   |

## Daily Planning

### "What should I do today?"

Ask this in the morning to get a personalized plan:

```
You: what should I do today?

Vibe: Here's your plan for today:

**Must Do**
- [ ] Finish quarterly report (due today!)

**Focus Time** (tackle these when you have energy)
- [ ] Prepare Monday's presentation
- [ ] Review team proposals

**Quick Wins** (low energy moments)
- [ ] Call the vet
- [ ] Text Sarah about budget

Does this look right? Just reply to adjust.
```

### How Vibe Planning Creates Your Plan

1. **Checks due dates** - Anything due today goes in "Must Do"
2. **Matches your energy** - Complex tasks suggested for mornings, simple ones for afternoon slumps
3. **Limits the list** - Only 3-5 "Most Important Tasks" so you're not overwhelmed
4. **Leaves buffer** - Room for unexpected things that pop up

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Vibe Planning

### 1. Do a weekly brain dump

Every Sunday (or Monday morning), email everything on your mind. Don't organize, don't prioritize - just dump it all out. Vibe Planning will sort it for you.

### 2. Text throughout the day

- Morning: "What should I focus on?"
- After completing something: "Done with [task]"
- When you think of something: "Add task: [description]"
- Stuck on what to do: "Quick wins for 10 minutes?"

### 3. Be natural with your language

You don't need special commands. Just write like you're texting a friend:

- "I need to remember to call mom tonight"
- "done with groceries"
- "what's most important right now?"
- "add: buy milk on the way home"

### 4. Include helpful details

The more context you give, the better Vibe Planning can help:

**Less helpful:**

> "doctor"

**More helpful:**

> "Schedule annual physical with Dr. Johnson - need to do it before insurance renews in March"

### 5. Review your Someday list

Once a month, ask: "Show me my someday tasks"

Move things to active that you're ready for, or let go of things you know you won't do.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if Vibe Planning categorizes something wrong?**

Just reply and tell it! "Actually, 'call Sarah' is a work task, not personal." It will update and remember your preference.

**Q: Can I set due dates?**

Yes! Include them naturally:

- "Finish report by Friday"
- "Call mom tomorrow"
- "Get gift before December 15"

**Q: What happens to completed tasks?**

They're moved to your "completed" list. You can always see them on your dashboard - great for feeling accomplished and for weekly reviews.

**Q: Can I undo marking something complete?**

Yes, just text: "Actually, I didn't finish [task]" and it will be moved back to active.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many tasks I can have?**

For the free plan: 50 active tasks, 20 emails/day, 10 texts/day. That's plenty for most people!

**Q: What if I want to add notes to a task?**

Include them in your message:

> "Add task: Buy anniversary gift - she mentioned wanting that blue scarf from Nordstrom, or maybe those earrings we saw last month"
